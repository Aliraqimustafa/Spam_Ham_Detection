# Spam/Ham Message Classification Project

Welcome to the Spam/Ham Message Classification project! In this project, we've developed a model to classify messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99% on the test data. This project is particularly valuable for businesses aiming to categorize messages effectively.
